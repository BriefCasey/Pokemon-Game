# Pokemon-Game
# python project for a class, I recreated the pokemon fighting system
# The game will be a pokemon style game. Being able to choose from three different pokemon, and having it battle with another pokemon. Each pokemon has 4 moves to choose from, varying from attacking moves to healing moves, and even a poison move that will slowly whittle down the opponents health. The player(s) will take turns choosing moves and the other player or the computer will take their turn and it will go back and forth until one pokemonâ€™s health reaches zero.
